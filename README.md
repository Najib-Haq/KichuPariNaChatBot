# KichuPariNaChatBot
Please run the KichuPariNaBot.py with appropriate modules maintaining the instructions. 
The login authentication part has been attached to this file. But the chat bot couldn't be integrated to the cloud.
The key features that have been implemented:

1. Authentication
2. Interact with the User by text and sound
3. Capture user image
4. Detect mood of a user
5. Suggest songs from youtube based on mood
6. Show lyrics of a specific song

We tried our best even though the topics were really unfamiliar to us. Hopefully our efforts satisfy you.

Best Regards,

Team KichuPariNa
